      <h1>Palindrome Problem</h1>
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
      <p>The word or whole phrase which has the same sequence of letters in both directions is called a palindrome. As you can see, case of the letters is ignored. Spaces and punctuations are ignored too.  Your goal in this programming exercise is to write a method that determines whether a phrase represents a palindrome or not.</p>
      <p>Insert text:</p>
      <input type="text" id="myPhrase">
      <button onCLick="isPalindrome()">Ok.</button>

      <h1>Josephus Problem</h1>
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
      <p>At some point there was a war, and during one of its battles defendants were blocked by attackers in the cave. To avoid capture they decided to stand in a circle and kill each third until only one person remained. That person was supposed to commit suicide. He eventually decided to just surrender. ¯\(ツ)/¯. Apparently this is a real thing that happened and the guy's name was Josephus.</p>
      <p>Your task is to write a method called LastPersonStanding that, for a given number of people numberOfPeople and killing interval killingInterval, determines the position of the person who remains alive - i.e. the Josephus position. For example if there are 10 people and they kill every third person:</p>
      <p>Enter Number of Defenders:</p>
      <input type="text" id="defenders">
      <p>Enter killing interval:</p>
      <input type="text" id="killingInterval">
      <button onClick="lastPersonStanding()">Go!</button>

      <h1>Pizza Toppings</h1>
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
      <p>A pizza chain wants to know which topping combinations are most popular for Build Your Own pizzas.  Given the sample of orders at <a>http://files.olo.com/pizzas.json</a>  , write an application (in C#, F# or JavaScript) to output the top 20 most frequently ordered pizza configurations, listing the toppings for each along with the number of times that pizza configuration has been ordered.</p>
